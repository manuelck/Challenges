# ☕ JS TIME CONTROL

## ℹ️ About the challenge.
This project marks my initial foray into JavaScript development, where I set out to challenge myself by creating a countdown timer and a chronometer. As a beginner in JavaScript, I aimed to grasp fundamental concepts such as time-related functions and DOM manipulation while building practical applications.
