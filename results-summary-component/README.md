# ☕ Results Summary Component
In this challenge, I had to recreate in Html and CSS a result component.
This challenge helped me to get more comfortable with styling. Still, the final code requires to use a grid, and I did not use any at all. I used flex box. So I will put myself to learn grid in a proper way and update the code.
